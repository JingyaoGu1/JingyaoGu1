####  Iâ€™m currently working full time as a frontend developer at [Dave's Redistricting App](https://davesredistricting.org) and a data analyst at [Redistricting Data Hub](https://redistrictingdatahub.org)  
At Dave's Redistricting App, I use React + Typescript to develop new features that mostly related to data, maps, colors and statistics.  
At Redistricting Data Hub, I use Python(Pandas) + Redshift + S3 to clean, extract, process, aggregate/disaggregate, automate large amount of election data(statewide, local, Census, voterfile, ACS) & geography boundaries(precinct, local).
